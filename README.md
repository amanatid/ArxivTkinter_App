# **ArxivTkinter App** 
## **Short Description** 
We create an ArxivTkinter App where  a specific query , the number of files  and a specific criterion is provided, and you get the pdf files and their abstracts.

It is a  an Tkinter application for  downloading papers and their abstracts from the Arxiv  in pdf format based on a query, the number of files and a specified criterion(relevance, last updated ,submitted date). More specifically, it downloads the papers in the current  folder under  directory name "/papers" and  the abstracts in the "abstracts.pdf" file.

### **Quick Start**  
- Run the ArxivApp.py
- Input Query and number of files and choose relevance, last updated or submitted date
- Exports the  pdf files in the current_dir/papers  along with the abstracts.pdf file

Also I provide a sample picture  how the  abstracts are in the abstracts.pdf file.

### **Issues** 
It is a bit slow on downloading the pdf files. Possibly this is due to the arxiv python lib.
